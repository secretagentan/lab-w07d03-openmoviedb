# üé¨ Open Movie DB

Let's practice making calls to the OMDbAPI.
This API is free and open so we can try hitting it from the client side with AJAX.

# Setup

No need for an express server just yet!
Just run `http-server` from inside `public`

# User Stories

When a user enters a search term and clicks search
    - Use AJAX to search OMDB's database by title
    - Render a list of results in `#results`

When a user clicks on a search result
    - Use AJAX to search OMDB's database by IMDb ID
    - Render the title, plot and poster in `#detail`

# ‚úã But wait!

With Node we wrote small modules using the Request module to make HTTP requests.
Could you apply this idea to your client-side code as well?

Create a `omdbapi.js` file and write two methods

```
OMDB.search(title, callback)
OMDB.find(imdbID, callback)
```

# üñº What about rendering?

Can you use new template strings to render to the DOM?

# ‚úåÔ∏è The Sequel?!

Can you add an express backend that persists favorited movies?
When a user visits '/faves' should movies you've persisted to MongoDB.
